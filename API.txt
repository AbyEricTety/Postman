APIs enable different software systems to communicate and interact with each other. 
They define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. 

Their security is crucial because APIs often handle sensitive data and facilitate critical functions. 
Breaches in API security can lead to data leaks, unauthorized access, and even system failures, posing significant risks to organizations and their customers. 
Strong API security measures are essential to protect data integrity, maintain user privacy, and ensure system reliability.
